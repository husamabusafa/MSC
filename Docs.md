Okay, transforming the technical documentation into a Business Requirements Document (BRD) means shifting focus from "how it's built" to "what business problem it solves" and "what capabilities it provides."

Here is the Business Requirements Document (BRD) for the Integrated Educational Platform.

### **1. Introduction**

This document outlines the business requirements for the "Integrated Educational Platform," a comprehensive digital ecosystem designed for a university faculty. The platform aims to centralize and streamline key academic, library, and commerce functions, providing a highly accessible, user-friendly, and efficient experience for its two primary user groups: Students and Administrators.

The core objective is to enhance the digital learning and administrative environment, foster student engagement, and improve operational efficiency through modern, intuitive technology.

### **2. Business Goals & Objectives**

The primary goals for the Integrated Educational Platform are:

*   **2.1. Enhance Student Learning & Engagement:** Provide students with a centralized, intuitive, and accessible portal for all academic resources (courses, quizzes, flashcards) and supplementary services (library, store).
*   **2.2. Improve Administrative Efficiency:** Equip faculty administrators with robust tools to efficiently manage users, academic content, library resources, and store operations, reducing manual workload and potential errors.
*   **2.3. Foster Inclusivity & Accessibility:** Deliver a fully bilingual experience (English & Arabic) with comprehensive internationalization, including Right-to-Left (RTL) language support, and user-configurable theming (Light/Dark mode) for optimal visual comfort.
*   **2.4. Establish a Modern Digital Foundation:** Implement a scalable, high-performance, and maintainable platform that can evolve with the university's future needs, leveraging modern web technologies.
*   **2.5. Centralize Faculty Operations:** Consolidate disparate systems and processes into a single, unified platform for improved data consistency and streamlined workflows.

### **3. Scope**

The scope of this project encompasses the development and deployment of a web-based, full-stack application comprising two distinct user interfaces:

*   **Student Panel:** Accessible to all registered students for academic, library, and store interactions.
*   **Admin Panel:** Securely accessible only to authorized administrators for platform management.

**In-Scope Features:**
*   User Management (Student & Admin)
*   Internationalization (English & Arabic, including RTL support)
*   Theming (Light & Custom High-Contrast Dark Modes)
*   Academic Content Management (Levels, Courses, Flashcards, Quizzes, Questions, Answers, GPA Subjects)
*   Al-Jalees Club Library Management (Books, Borrow Requests)
*   Store Management (Product Categories, Products, Orders)
*   Core application infrastructure for data management and API services.

**Out-of-Scope (for this initial phase):**
*   Integration with external university SIS (Student Information Systems) or ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems.
*   Mobile native applications (the platform will be web-based and responsive).
*   Advanced analytics beyond basic reporting.
*   Live chat or real-time communication features.

### **4. Stakeholders**

The key stakeholders for this project include:

*   **University Faculty Management:** Project Sponsors, strategic decision-makers.
